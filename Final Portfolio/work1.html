        <p class="concepttext" id="concepttext">One's appearance may be the face everyone sees in the mirror every day, but one's appearance is the most unfamiliar in our memory. When I was very young, I liked to stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself because the mirror was my familiar and strange friend. We often listen to our friends' stories about their troubles, but we don't seem to have the opportunity to listen to our inner thoughts and feelings to explore our most natural self. The process of painting a self-portrait is not only a dialogue with yourself but also a method of feeling the joy and sorrow you have experienced. The stories you have experienced may leave traces on your face, so we could look at our self-portrait when there is anxiety or dissatisfaction with your appearance. Maybe it can let us explore our value, not just stay thinking about the appearance shape.

            The inspiration for the work came from my mother showing me photos of me from different periods at home. Time passes, and no one can keep it, so I hope to use painting and scrapbooking to leave a mark on the good times in my life, and these good marks can also serve as my motivation to move forward. Nowadays, we are so used to relying on electronic products to record our lives that we have forgotten the meaning of photo albums. The work records eternal time through the combination of photo albums and creativity. Scene by scene, I was standing in front of the camera instead of the person looking at the photo. My appearance seems to record my years and emotions because at every age, my appearance will have some minor changes, or "grow up," as my mother often says. It occurred to me that if I could cut and paste all the photos representing my life's turning points into one piece, I could feel my life in one painting. When the work was finished, it was as if I was looking at my appearance with new eyes because my face had accompanied me through different periods, and maybe my face was my best friend.</p>

            "Artistic life" made with wool and button paste. The girl in the piece is me, and I wanted to express my unique self more artistically and creatively. I chose to use wool as the material not only because it gives a warm meaning to Chinese characters but also as an expression of love. During the New Year, a mother may knit a sweater or mittens for her child with wool, hoping her child will feel her mother's love and longing. When I use wool to create this painting, I also hope that when the viewer sees the wool, they will think that their parents also give their appearance. In parents' hearts, your appearance is unique, and the most beautiful; no matter what the world's evaluation of your appearance is, your appearance is the favorite of your parents and family.
